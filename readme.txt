### Subscription Renewal Reminders for WooCommerce

<p><strong>To meet the new US Federal Trade Commission (FTC),  we have added a Click to Cancel option on the subscription reminder emails. You may use your preferred custom text on the button.</strong> </p>

Subscriptions Renewal Reminders allows you to send your subscribers a Renewal notifications by Emails X days before their subscription ends. This plugin only works with the WooCommerce Subscriptions plugin.

Subscription Renewal reminder emails are only sent to active subscribers. Emails will not be sent to customers whose subscription is On hold or Suspended.

Sending subscription renewal reminders is a great way to remind your customers abou the benefits of their subscription and encourage interaction with your product. Some juristrications may also require that send a reminder email before automatically charing a customer on a subscription. So install this plugin to make sure your customers have not forgotten their subscriptions and are aware of the upcoming charge.

The email reminder that the plugin sends to your WooCommerce Subscription customers is completely customisable by you. We have a Wysiwyg editor to cretate the perfect reminder email for your specific customer.

You can also decide when the reminder email is sent to your subscription customers. For example, 3 days before their subscription renews.

We also have a premium version of the plugin that has expanded functionality.
